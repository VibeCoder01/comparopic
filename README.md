# Photo Comparator

A single-page app to compare two photos using instant flip, fade blending, and a draggable divider reveal.

## Features
- Instant flip between two photos (button or click on the image)
- Fade slider to blend between images
- Divider reveal with drag-to-move and slider control
- Local file uploads, no server required

## Usage
Open `index.html` in your browser and upload two images.

Optional: run a tiny local server if your browser blocks local file access:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.
